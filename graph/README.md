# Graph Data Structure

Here I have defined a graph data structure class with basic functionalities, like a 'get parent' function, 'get children' function, 'add element' function, and a 'print len' function.
I would be inheriting and extending the same class to define Depth first, breadth first, Heaps, and other graph related algorithms from this class.
